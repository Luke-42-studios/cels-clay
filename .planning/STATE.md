## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure following build -> layout -> render bridge -> renderer -> demo dependency chain
- [Roadmap]: CORE-01 and CORE-03 (arena init, error handler) placed in Phase 1 with build system rather than Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- cels-ncurses drawing primitives gap: PROJECT.md notes the planned graphics API is "not yet built." Phase 4 may need to build ncurses drawing helpers or work directly on stdscr.
